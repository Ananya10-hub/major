        "Lung cancer is a malignant tumor that begins in the lungs. The two main types are small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Common symptoms include persistent cough, chest pain, coughing up blood, and shortness of breath. Risk factors include smoking, exposure to secondhand smoke, family history, and exposure to radon gas or asbestos.",
        
        "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% of lung cancers. The main subtypes are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma typically occurs in the outer parts of the lung and is the most common type in non-smokers. Squamous cell carcinoma is often linked to smoking and usually occurs in the central part of the lungs.",
        
        "Treatment options for lung cancer depend on the type, stage, and patient's overall health. Early-stage cancer may be treated with surgery (wedge resection, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy). Advanced stages often require combination therapy including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or targeted drug treatments. The 5-year survival rate varies significantly based on the stage at diagnosis.",
        
        "Lung cancer staging uses the TNM system: Tumor size (T1-T4), lymph Node involvement (N0-N3), and Metastasis (M0-M1). Stage I means the cancer is localized to the lung, Stage II has spread to nearby lymph nodes, Stage III has spread to regional lymph nodes or structures, and Stage IV has spread to distant organs.",
        
        "Prevention and screening are crucial in lung cancer management. Regular screening with low-dose CT scans is recommended for high-risk individuals. Smoking cessation is the most effective prevention method. Other preventive measures include avoiding secondhand smoke, testing homes for radon, and minimizing exposure to workplace carcinogens."
